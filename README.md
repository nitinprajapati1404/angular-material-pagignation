# Installing the Angular CLI

With the following command the angular-cli will be installed globally in your machine:

    npm install -g @angular/cli 


# How To install this repository

We can install the master branch using the following commands:

    git clone https://github.com/nitinprajapati1404/angular-material-pagignation.git
    
This repository is made of several separate npm modules, that are installable separately. For example, to run the au-input module, we can do the following:
    
    cd angular-material-pagignation
    npm install

Its also possible to install the modules as usual using npm:

    npm install 

NPM 5 or above has the big advantage that if you use it you will be installing the exact same dependencies than I installed in my machine, so you wont run into issues caused by semantic versioning updates.

This should take a couple of minutes. If there are issues, please post the complete error message in the Questions section of the course.
